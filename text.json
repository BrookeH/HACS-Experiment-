        "content": "Lennie went behind the tree and brought out a litter of dried leaves and twigs. He threw them in a heap on the old ash pile and went back for more and more. It was almost night now. A dove\u2019s wings whistled over the water. George walked to the fire pile and lighted the dry leaves. The flame cracked up among the twigs and fell to work. George undid his bindle and brought out three cans of beans. He stood them about the fire, close in against the blaze, but not quite touching the flame.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s enough beans for four men,\u201D George said. \r\n\r\nLennie watched him from over the fire. He said patiently, \u201CI like \u2018em with ketchup.\u201D \r\n\r\n\u201CWell, we ain\u2019t got any,\u201D George exploded. \u201CWhatever we ain\u2019t got, that\u2019s what you want. God a\u2019mighty, if I was alone I could live so easy. I could go get a job an\u2019 work, an\u2019 no trouble. No mess at all, and when the end of the month come I could take my fifty bucks and go into town and get whatever I want. Why, I could stay in a cat house all night. I could eat any place I want, hotel or any place, and order any damn thing I could think of. An\u2019 I could do all that every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room and play cards or shoot pool.\u201D Lennie knelt and looked over the fire at the angry George. And Lennie\u2019s face was drawn with terror. \u201CAn\u2019 whatta I got,\u201D George went on furiously. \u201CI got you! You can\u2019t keep a job and you lose me ever\u2019 job I get. Jus\u2019 keep me shoving\u2019 all over the country all the time. An\u2019 that ain\u2019t the worst. You get in trouble. You do bad things and I got to get you out.\u201D His voice rose nearly to a shout. \u201CYou crazy son-of-a-bitch. You keep me in hot water all the time.\u201D He took on the elaborate manner of little girls when they are mimicking one another. \u201CJus\u2019 wanted to feel that girl\u2019s dress \u2014 jus\u2019 wanted to pet it like it was a mouse \u2014 Well, how the hell did she know you jus\u2019 wanted to feel her dress? She jerks back and you hold on like it was a mouse. She yells and we got to hide in a irrigation ditch all day with guys lookin\u2019 for us, and we got to sneak out in the dark and get outta the country. All the time somethin\u2019 like that \u2014 all the time. I wisht I could put you in a cage with about a million mice an\u2019 let you have fun.\u201D His anger left him suddenly. He looked across the fire at Lennie\u2019s anguished face, and then he looked ashamedly at the flames. \r\n\r\nIt was quite dark now, but the fire lighted the trunks of the trees and the curving branches overhead. Lennie crawled slowly and cautiously around the fire until he was close to George. He sat back on his heels. George turned the bean cans so that another side faced the fire. He pretended to be unaware of Lennie so close beside him. \r\n\u201CGeorge,\u201D very softly. No answer. \u201CGeorge!\u201D \r\n\u201CWhatta you want?\u201D \r\n\u201CI was only foolin\u2019, George. I don\u2019t want no ketchup.\u201D",

		"content":"The Maycomb jail was the most venerable and hideous of the county\u2019s buildings. Atticus said it was like something Cousin Joshua St Clair might have designed. It was certainly someone\u2019s dream. Starkly out of place in a town of square-faced stores and steep-roofed houses, the Maycomb jail was a miniature Gothic joke one cell wide and two cells high, complete with tiny battlements and flying buttresses. Its fantasy was heightened by its red brick fa\u00E7ade and the thick steel bars at its ecclesiastical windows. It stood on no lonely hill, but was wedged between Tyndal\u2019s Hardware Store and the Maycomb Tribune office. The jail was Maycomb\u2019s only conversation piece: its detractors said it looked like a Victorian privy; its supporters said it gave the town a good solid respectable look, and no stranger would ever suspect that it was full of niggers. \r\n\r\nAs we walked up the sidewalk, we saw a solitary light burning in the distance. \u201CThat\u2019s funny,\u201D said Jem, \u201Cjail doesn\u2019t have an outside light.\u201D \r\n\r\n\u201CLooks like it\u2019s over the door,\u201D said Dill. \r\n\r\nA long extension cord ran between the bars of a second floor window and down the side of the building. In the light from its bare bulb, Atticus was sitting propped against the front door. He was sitting in one of his office chairs, and he was reading, oblivious of the nightbugs dancing over his head. \r\n\r\nI made to run, but Jem caught me. \u201CDon\u2019t go to him,\u201D he said, \u201Che might not like it. He\u2019s all right, let\u2019s go home. I just wanted to see where he was.\u201D \r\n\r\nWe were taking a short cut across the square when four dusty cars came in from the Meridian highway, moving slowly in a line. They went around the square, passed the bank building, and stopped in front of the jail. \r\n\r\nNobody got out. We saw Atticus look up from his newspaper. He closed it, folded it deliberately, dropped it in his lap, and pushed his hat to the back of his head. He seemed to be expecting them. \r\n\r\n\u201CCome on,\u201D whispered Jem. We sneaked across the square, across the street, until we were in the shelter of the Jitney Jungle door. Jem peeked up the sidewalk. \u201CWe can get closer,\u201D he said. We ran to Tyndal\u2019s Hardware door \u2014 near enough, at the same time discreet. \r\n\r\nIn ones and twos, men got out of the cars. Shadows became substance as light revealed solid shapes moving towards the jail door. Atticus remained where he was. The men hid him from view. \r\n\r\n\u201CHe in there, Mr Finch?\u201D a man said. \r\n\r\n\u201CHe is,\u201D we heard Atticus answer, \u201Cand he\u2019s asleep. Don\u2019t wake him up.\u201D",

Finally he said: \r\n\r\n\u201CI do not understand it. I would not have believed that such things could happen on our farm. It must be due to some fault in ourselves. The solution, as I see it, is to work harder. From now onwards I shall get up a full hour earlier in the mornings.\u201D \r\n\r\nAnd he moved off at his lumbering trot and made for the quarry. Having got there he collected two successive loads of stone and dragged them down to the windmill before retiring for the night. \r\n\r\nThe animals huddled around Clover, not speaking. The knoll where they were lying gave them a wide prospect across the countryside. Most of Animal Farm was within their view \u2014 the long pasture stretching down to the main road, the hayfield, the spinney, the drinking pool, the ploughed fields where the young wheat was thick and green, and the red roofs of the farm buildings with the smoke curling from the chimneys. It was a clear spring evening. The grass and the bursting hedges were gilded by the level rays of the sun. Never had the farm \u2014 and with a kind of surprise they remembered that it was their own farm, every inch of it their own property \u2014 appeared to the animals so desirable a place. As Clover looked down the hillside her eyes filled with tears. If she could have spoken her thoughts, it would have been to say that this was not what they had aimed at when they had set themselves years ago to work for the overthrow of the human race. These scenes of terror and slaughter were not what they had looked forward to on that night when old Major first stirred them to rebellion. If she herself had any picture of the future, it had been of a society of animals set free from hunger and the whip, all equal, each working according to his capacity, the strong protecting the weak, as she had protected the lost brood of ducklings with her foreleg on the night of Major\u2019s speech. Instead \u2014 she did not know why \u2014 they had come to a time when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed everywhere, and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after confessing to shocking crimes. There was no thought of rebellion or disobedience in her mind. She knew that even as things were they were far better off than they had been in the days of Jones, and that before all else it was needful to prevent the return of the human beings. Whatever happened she would remain faithful, work hard, carry out the orders that were given to her, and accept the leadership of Napoleon. But still, it was not for this that she and all the other animals had hoped and toiled.",
